Just unzip and run the exe.
All dependencies (SSL & Qt) are packaged inside the zip file.

If you have any issues about missing DLL, please open an Issue

Dont forget to activate and allow api access (SmartConsole -> Manage Settings -> Blades -> Management API -> Advanced Settings -> Accept API calls)
